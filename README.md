Repository for assignment 2 in comp-2511

Trey L., Harshvir G., Borys P.

Trey: I did the majority of the default sizing (small) and worked with Harsh on the grid for medium/large. I made the navigation for both pages, the header for the homepage, and handled the removing of the contact us page and all related CSS. I also removed unneccessary code leftover from assignment 1 that wasn't required for this assignment 2 (ie. links to different parts of the website).
