Trey L., Harshvir G., Borys P.

Trey made the contact us page, navigation table, our events table, styling of each of those tables, cleaned dead or unoptimized CSS code in main.css, organized all CSS into their respective pages and designated categories, added and edited documentation for all CSS, added the auto-scroll link, edited the contact us page's styling to apply to all elements of the form, styled the homepage with Harsh, adjusted selectors, and made small tweaks throughout the project.

Harsh wrote all elements and content of the home page (excluding the events table), styled the homepage, validated semantic use in the project, and verified code to ensure all three pages follow the criteria. 

Borys devoloped the layout of the about us page, did most styling for the contact us page, styled textboxes, and created the selectors.

Each of us wrote our own 'About Me' paragraphs and pictures.
