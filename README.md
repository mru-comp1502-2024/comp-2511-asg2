Repository for assignment 2 in comp-2511

Trey L., Harshvir G., Borys P.

Trey: I did the majority of the default sizing (small) and worked with Harsh on the grid for medium/large. I made the navigation for both pages, the header for the homepage, and handled the removing of the contact us page and all related CSS. I also removed unneccessary code leftover from assignment 1 that wasn't required for this assignment 2 (ie. links to different parts of the website).

Harshvir:
I created the 2x2 grid layout and intialized it across both websites (aboutUs and Homepage). I adjusted the 2x2 grid and worked through it with Trey to make it look the best it could be. I adjusted and fixed some small device issues with spacing between content boxes and the logo image sizing for small device. I added the media query for the large device that followed the mostly fluid layout. I tried to adjust the footer and contact form to be spread out accordingly. I did HTML validation and checked one portion of accessibility of color contrast ratio using WebAim across the website.
