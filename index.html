            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Throughout the student career of education, students complete a lot of tasks
                from assignments, quizzes, tests, finals, and diplomas at some point in time.
                Students oftentimes face stress or anxiety while completing a task from school.
                We'd agree that participating in Extracurricular activities help students manage stress.
                These type of activities focus our attention away from our problems and enjoy the nature of extracurriculars.
                Extracurricular activies include joining a club, a team, intramurals or doing sports on the side.
